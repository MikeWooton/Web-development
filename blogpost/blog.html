		<h2>A tribute to teachers, who always seem to have the answers</h2>

		<p class="quote">I started sixth grade as a shy student at a new school who spent recess hiding in a bathroom stall because I hadn’t made any friends yet. But I found solace in English class, where Mrs. Ivey whisked me far away from the stresses of middle school to the world of Greek mythology. As her students, we could feel her passion for the subject which she made come alive through interactive assignments, visual projects and a whole lot of patience.

	    What I didn’t recognize at the time was how hard Mrs. Ivey worked behind the scenes or between the bells. She answered all of my questions, but I never considered who she would turn to for hers. So for World Teachers’ Day this year, we’re celebrating teachers who look to Google Search to find ways to engage their classrooms and empower their students. When you’re in school, teachers are your most important cheerleaders and advocates, so this World Teachers’ Day, it’s time for all of us to return the favor.</p>

		<h2>Safety Center: helping you stay safe online</h2>

		<p class="quote">
			Making technology for everyone means protecting everyone who uses it. For 20 years, Google has been building useful products to help make people’s lives easier. From the beginning, we’ve always known that when people use our services, they’re trusting us with their information and it’s our job to protect it.

            Today, we started rolling out a newly expanded Google Safety Center. We’ve updated our resources and pulled even more information into one site dedicated to educating and empowering people on important topics like data security, privacy controls, and online protections for all of our users. The site will be available in more than 65 languages in the coming weeks.
